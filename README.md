This project is a simple animation of atoms moving and colliding within a canvas. Each atom consists of an outer circle, an inner circle, electrons, and a neutron. The electrons move in a vibrating motion influenced by temperature, and the atoms move randomly within the canvas. The animation is initiated by clicking a start button, and temperature control is provided to adjust the vibrational speed of the electrons.

## How to Use

1. **Start Animation:**

   - Open `index.html` in a web browser.
   - Click the "Start" button to initiate the atom animation.

2. **Restart Animation:**

   - Click the "Restart" button to reset the animation.

3. **Temperature Control:**
   - Adjust the temperature using the temperature range input.
   - The color of the temperature display changes based on the temperature value.

## Files

- **index.html:** Contains the HTML structure and links to the JavaScript and CSS files.
- **style.css:** Defines the styling for the HTML elements.
- **script.js:** Implements the logic for the atom animation, including the classes for electrons, neutrons, circles, and atoms.

## Additional Information

- The project uses HTML5 canvas for rendering the animation.
- Atom objects are created with random initial positions and velocities to add diversity to the animation.
- Collision detection is implemented to handle interactions between atoms.

## Dependencies

- No external libraries or frameworks are used.
